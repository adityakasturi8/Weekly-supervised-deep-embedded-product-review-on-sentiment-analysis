1	"Attempts to get the camera fixed overseas were futile, as they would not honor a US warranty"	
1	"Also, soon after we purchased this model, my husband and I stood side by side taking the same picture with this and a Samsung comparable model, both on automatic, and found the resulting pictures to have no noticeable difference"

2	"I had a Cannon Sure-shut point&shoot 35mm camera before"	
2	"Some of the photos I even enlarged to 14x11 ' and still looked sharp"	
2	"Rough resolutions, - it is the worst I've experinced after using many other point-shoot cameras"	
2	"The lighting conditions have to be perfect to get decent resolutions"	
2	"Use of slower speed films did not help either"

4	"Overall, this is a great phone if you want a solid phone without some of the frills and come-ons of some of many newer phones (ie, color screens, cameras, etc"	
4	")Also, if you purchase this phone also order the premium leather case Amazon offers"

1	"The digital camera world is moving at a very fast pace, I'm sure there's something more up to date in this price range"
