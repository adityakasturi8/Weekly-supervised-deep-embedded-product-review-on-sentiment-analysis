Weakly-supervised Deep Embedding for Product Review Sentiment Analysis

**Link to the Actual Paper :** https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8051113

**Abstract:**
Product reviews are valuable for upcoming buyers in helping them make decisions. To this end, different opinion mining techniques have been proposed, where judging a review sentence's orientation (e.g., positive or negative) is one of their key challenges. Recently, deep learning has emerged as an effective means for solving sentiment classification problems. A neural network intrinsically learns a useful representation automatically without human efforts. However, the success of deep learning highly relies on the availability of large-scale training data. We propose a novel deep learning framework for product review sentiment classification which employs prevalently available ratings as weak supervision signals. The framework consists of two steps: (1) learning a high level representation (an embedding space) which captures the general sentiment distribution of sentences through rating information; and (2) adding a classification layer on top of the embedding layer and use labeled sentences for supervised fine-tuning. We explore two kinds of low level network structure for modeling review sentences, namely, convolutional feature extractors and long short-term memory. To evaluate the proposed framework, we construct a dataset containing 1.1M weakly labeled review sentences and 11,754 labeled review sentences from Amazon. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed framework and its superiority over baselines.

**In Simple Terms :**
In Ecommerce world product reviews are very important for the purchaser to purchase good quality product. All existing systems were using data mining classifier based on product rating which was not giving correct classification. All reviews accompanied with text and rating values and just considering rating will drive users to make wrong decision.

**Example from paper**

From above image we can see review content negative words but given 5 start ratings. To overcome from this issue author has introduce two algorithms which will process review text (review text mining also called as Deep Learning) and rating information to get correct label such as Positive or Negative.

**Algorithm1:** Convolutional Neural Network-Weakly-supervised Deep Embedding (CNN-WDE): This algorithm generate features vector using neural network technique and then identify label for review. 
Algorithm2: Long Short-Term Memory-Weakly-supervised Deep Embedding (LSTM-WDE) this algorithm is similar to first one but it will process reviews in window size instead of processing all and due to this window size performance will drop down. CNN-WDE is better compare to LSTM-WDE.

CNN-WDE builds feature vector along with rating value and algorithm will give value weather review is positive or not.  CNN-WDE all reviews will be train and later test review will apply on train review to predict label.

Weakly-supervised deep refers to mining on text data.

To implement this project I have downloaded some reviews from internet and saved inside dataset folder

Now click on ‘Detect Sentiment Labels’ to detect either review is positive or negative

From above screen in first row rating is 5 but review text contains negative words and later by using this paper algorithm we found out that review is negative. Now click on ‘Sentiment Prediction Graph’ button to give input as review and then this input will test again train model to detect weather input is positive or negative

Now in above screen we can see input is identified as positive
